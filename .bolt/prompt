CRITICAL UI COMPONENT PREFERENCES:
- NEVER use alert(), confirm(), or prompt() - ALWAYS use proper modal components
- ALWAYS prefer existing UI components over custom HTML
- Use the component library that's already established in the project
- Keep components small and focused (DSL-like, only tens of lines each)
- Always use consistent Button, Modal, Input, and other UI components throughout
- NEVER USE GHOST BUTTONS! Always use primary, secondary, or danger variants with proper colors and visibility

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Make all designs beautiful and production-worthy, not cookie cutter
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with thoughtful color gradients and modern aesthetics
- Implement hover states, transitions, and micro-interactions
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes
- Use lucide-react for all icons and logos
- Apply consistent spacing (8px system) and typography
- Use proper visual hierarchy and contrast ratios

COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:
- Break down UI into tiny, reusable components
- Each component should be focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer composition over large monolithic components
- Use existing components as building blocks for new features
